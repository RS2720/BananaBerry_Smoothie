This is a simple recipe which I created. It includes blueberries and bananas. Blueberries are high in antioxidants which are great for your brain. They are also known to reduce blood pressure and other heart-related issues. Bananas have a vast list of benefits. They are high in potassium and calcium. It is made by layering all of the ingredients into your blender in such a way thatg the break-down process is smooth. This recipe does not include sugar either as it uses ripe fruits which are naturally sweet. This recipe can be consumed in tyhe morning or as an evening snack.
