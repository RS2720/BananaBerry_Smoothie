This recipe includes 6 ingredients.

1. 1 Fresh Banana. 
It is best if the banana is ripe as that adds some extra sweetness. This recipe is a great way to use the bananas which are too ripe to eat

2. 400 ml Unsweetend Almond Milk or your prefered milk.
I used almond milk because it has a neutral taste and complements the blueberries and bananas well.

3. 1 teaspoon Hemp Seeds
These are a great addition as they add Omega-3s and a bit of crunch.

4. 1 teaspoon Chia Seeds
These are a powerful seed and are a great source of energy.

5. 1 teaspoon Almond Butter
These add some healthy fats and substance to the shake. Vary this amount depending how vicous you want the shake.

6. 3/4 cup Frozen BlueBerries
The frozen blueberries make the smoothie cold and make you enjoy it more. The blueberrie also add a multitude of benefits.

This makes one serving.
