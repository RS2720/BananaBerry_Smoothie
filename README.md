# BananaBerry_Smoothie

#Explaination
This is a simple recipe which I created. It includes blueberries and bananas. Blueberries are high in antioxidants which are great for your brain. They are also known to reduce blood pressure and other heart-related issues. Bananas have a vast list of benefits. They are high in potassium and calcium. It is made by layering all of the ingredients into your blender in such a way thatg the break-down process is smooth. This recipe does not include sugar either as it uses ripe fruits which are naturally sweet. This recipe can be consumed in tyhe morning or as an evening snack.

#Ingredients
This recipe includes 6 ingredients.

1. 1 Fresh Banana. 
It is best if the banana is ripe as that adds some extra sweetness. This recipe is a great way to use the bananas which are too ripe to eat

2. 400 ml Unsweetend Almond Milk or your prefered milk.
I used almond milk because it has a neutral taste and complements the blueberries and bananas well.

3. 1 teaspoon Hemp Seeds
These are a great addition as they add Omega-3s and a bit of crunch.

4. 1 teaspoon Chia Seeds
These are a powerful seed and are a great source of energy.

5. 1 teaspoon Almond Butter
These add some healthy fats and substance to the shake. Vary this amount depending how vicous you want the shake.

6. 3/4 cup Frozen BlueBerries
The frozen blueberries make the smoothie cold and make you enjoy it more. The blueberrie also add a multitude of benefits.

This makes one serving.
